But who are Bad Meets Evil and how did they come to be? Bad Meets Evil is not just a catchy name, but a reflection of the duo's contrasting personalities and styles. Eminem, also known as Slim Shady, is the Evil half, known for his dark humor, violent imagery, and controversial lyrics. Royce da 5'9", also known as Nickel Nine, is the Bad half, known for his street credibility, technical skills, and witty punchlines. The two rappers met in 1997 at a concert in Detroit, where Royce was opening for Usher. They became friends and started working together on various songs and freestyles.
  
One of their earliest collaborations was "Bad Meets Evil", a song that appeared on Eminem's breakthrough album The Slim Shady LP in 1999. The song showcased their chemistry and competitiveness, as they traded bars about murder, drugs, and sex. The song also gave them their group name, which was inspired by a line from the 1981 horror film The Evil Dead: "One by one we will take you...the evil dead". The duo followed up with a double-single in 1999, consisting of "Nuttin' to Do" and "Scary Movies", which gained them more attention and respect in the underground hip-hop scene.
  
However, their partnership was short-lived, as they soon became involved in a feud with Eminem's group D12. The feud stemmed from Royce's rivalry with D12 member Bizarre, who felt that Royce was trying to take Eminem away from them. The feud escalated into diss tracks, physical altercations, and even gunshots. The duo stopped working together and went their separate ways, focusing on their solo careers. Eminem became one of the biggest stars in the music industry, while Royce struggled with personal and legal issues.
