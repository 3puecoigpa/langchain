## Features of ArchiCAD 16
 
ArchiCAD 16 is not only a powerful BIM software, but also a rich source of innovative features that enhance your design and productivity. Here are some of the features that make ArchiCAD 16 stand out from the crowd:

- **Morph Tool**: This new tool allows you to create and edit any shape you can imagine, from organic forms to complex structures. You can sketch, extrude, rotate, and sculpt your morphs, and then classify them as architectural elements with attributes and properties. You can also use morphs to edit existing elements, such as walls, roofs, slabs, and beams.
- **BIM Components Portal**: This is a web-based platform that connects ArchiCAD users with a global database of high-quality BIM objects. You can browse, download, and upload BIM components for free, and access them directly from ArchiCAD. You can also rate and comment on the components, and request new ones from manufacturers and other users.
- **EcoDesigner**: This is an integrated energy analysis tool that helps you design more sustainable buildings. You can evaluate the energy performance of your building based on its geometry, location, orientation, materials, systems, and usage. You can also compare different design scenarios and optimize your design for energy efficiency.

These are just some of the features that make ArchiCAD 16 a great choice for architects who want to design better buildings with BIM.
