# How to Change the Language of Medieval II Total War and Kingdoms to English
 
Medieval II Total War and its expansion Kingdoms are popular strategy games that let you control various factions in medieval Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. However, some players may prefer to play the game in English rather than their native language, or they may have downloaded the game with a different language setting by mistake. In this article, we will show you how to change the language of Medieval II Total War and Kingdoms to English using a simple method.
 
The first step is to download the English localized pack file, which contains all the text and sound files for the English version of the game. You can find the link to download this file in the description below[^1^] [^2^]. The file size is only 2 MB, so it should not take long to download. Once you have downloaded the file, you need to copy it to your Medieval II Total War data folder, which is usually located in C:\Program Files\SEGA\Medieval II Total War\data. If you already have a localized pack file for another language, you need to delete it or rename it before copying the English one.

The second step is to change the language setting of your Steam account, if you have bought the game through Steam. To do this, you need to open Steam and go to Settings. Then, click on Interface and select English from the drop-down menu. You may need to restart Steam for the changes to take effect.
 
The third step is to install the English patch for Kingdoms, if you have installed the expansion. You can find the link to download this patch in the description below[^2^]. The patch size is about 1 GB, so it may take some time to download. Once you have downloaded the patch, you need to run it and follow the instructions. The patch will automatically detect your Kingdoms installation folder and update it with the English files.
