To create a 3D model of a part, you can start by creating a 2D sketch on a plane or a face. You can use various sketch tools such as lines, circles, arcs, rectangles, polygons, splines, and more. You can also apply constraints and dimensions to define the shape and size of your sketch. Then, you can use various modeling tools such as extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, hole, and more to create 3D features from your sketch. You can also edit and modify your features using direct editing tools such as move, rotate, scale, delete, and more.
 
To create a 2D drawing of your 3D model, you can start by creating a new drawing file and choosing a template. Then, you can use various drawing tools such as base view, projected view, section view, detail view, auxiliary view, and more to create views of your model on the drawing sheet. You can also use various annotation tools such as dimension, text, leader, symbol, table, balloon, and more to add information to your views. You can also edit and modify your views and annotations using tools such as move, rotate, scale, delete, align, break out section view tool ,and more.
