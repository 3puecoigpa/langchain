The album opens with "All I Want Is Love", a cheerful and optimistic song about finding love in a world full of challenges. The chorus is catchy and infectious, with backing vocals and claps that add to the energy. The song sets the tone for the rest of the album, which is full of positive messages and anthemic melodies.
 
One of the highlights of the album is "Hold Each Other", a duet with Futuristic that celebrates love in all its forms. The song starts with a piano intro and a tender verse by Ian Axel, followed by a rap verse by Futuristic that adds some contrast and diversity. The chorus is sung by both Axel and Chad King, who switch between male and female pronouns to express their universal love. The song is a beautiful and inclusive statement that resonates with listeners of any orientation.
 
Another standout track is "Oasis", a ballad that compares love to a desert oasis. The song features Ingrid Michaelson as a guest vocalist, who harmonizes perfectly with Axel and King. The song is soothing and romantic, with lyrics that evoke imagery of water, sand and stars. The song is a refreshing and relaxing break from the upbeat tempo of the rest of the album.
 
The album closes with "When The Morning Comes", a hopeful and inspiring song that encourages listeners to keep going despite the hardships they face. The song has a gospel-like feel, with a choir joining in the chorus and a bridge that builds up to a climactic finale. The song is a fitting end to an album that celebrates life, love and resilience.
