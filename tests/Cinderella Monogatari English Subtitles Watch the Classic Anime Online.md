## Cinderella Monogatari English Su: The Characters
 
Cinderella Monogatari English Su has a diverse and memorable cast of characters, each with their own personality and role in the story. The main character is Cinderella, voiced by Maria Kawamura in Japanese and Elisabetta Spinelli in Italian. She is a sweet and optimistic girl who loves her father and her animal friends. She is also brave and loyal, willing to stand up for what is right and help those in need. She wears a magic pendant that allows her to transform into a princess whenever she wishes.
 
The love interest of Cinderella is Charles, voiced by Masami Kikuchi in Japanese and Sylvain Goldberg in French. He is the prince of Emerald Castle, but he disguises himself as a commoner to explore the world and have fun. He is kind, adventurous, and curious, and he has a strong sense of justice. He is drawn to Cinderella's beauty and personality, but he does not know her true identity until the end of the story.
 
The other main characters are Cinderella's animal friends, who help her throughout her journey. They are Pappy, a wise and friendly dog voiced by Aki Matsushita; Bingo, a loyal and energetic mouse voiced by Tomohiro Tsuboi; Chuchu, a cute and cheerful bird voiced by Yayoi Nakazawa; and Wanda, a mischievous and sarcastic cat voiced by Tsutomu Tsuji. They also have the ability to talk to humans thanks to Cinderella's pendant.
 
## Cinderella Monogatari English Su: The Themes
 
Cinderella Monogatari English Su is not just a simple retelling of the fairytale, but also a story that explores some deeper themes and messages. One of the main themes is the importance of being true to oneself and following one's dreams. Cinderella does not let her harsh circumstances or her stepfamily's abuse stop her from being happy and hopeful. She also does not change herself to fit into the society's expectations or to please others. She stays true to her values and her heart, and she pursues her dream of being with Charles.
 
Another theme is the power of love and friendship. Cinderella finds support and comfort in her animal friends, who are always there for her no matter what. They also help her overcome her fears and challenges, and they encourage her to be confident and courageous. Cinderella also finds love in Charles, who accepts her for who she is and respects her choices. Their love is based on mutual trust, understanding, and admiration, not on superficial appearances or status.

A third theme is the contrast between good and evil. Cinderella represents the good side of humanity, with her kindness, generosity, and compassion. She treats everyone with respect and dignity, even those who mistreat her or try to harm her. She also forgives her stepfamily at the end of the story, showing that she does not hold any grudge or resentment. On the other hand, her stepmother and stepsisters represent the evil side of humanity, with their greed, selfishness, and cruelty. They abuse Cinderella physically and emotionally, they try to sabotage her happiness, and they do not care about anyone but themselves.
